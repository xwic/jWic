jWic Framework
==============

As you can guess, this is the jWic Project :-)

To make a build, execute the ant script. The distribution will be created in the _dist directory. If 
you want to create the distribution zip-files, execute the task "buildarchive". The zip files will
be created in the _distfiles directory.

If you want to join the project, simply contact us:

Florian Lippisch: flippisch@gmx.net
Jens Bornemann: cosote@gmx.net

Have fun with it! :)



IMPORTANT NOTE **FLI - 2008-09-15 **: I started jWic version 4.0, which will include the following changes/features:
- The new version will depend on Java 5.0 and support its new features
- Entire refactoring of the JavaScript libraries. We will make use of the prototype.js library
- Changing the ajax communication response to JSON format
