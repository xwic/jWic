jWic
====

jWic is a java-based development framework for developing dynamic web applications 
with the convenience and familiarity of 'rich client' style programming. It is 
extremely useful for interactive applications run in a browser. The appliation
renders HTML and uses JavaScript/Ajax to update the page state quickly. While
controls behavior is mostly handled via JavaScript on the client, the application
logic is running on the server side.
